# bytebeat-composer
Bytebeat player with playlist that contains many interesting formulas from the Internet.

Forked from StephanShi to fix some bugs and soon add new features
afaik this is the only bytebeat program that doesn't have any bugs (the two common ones are being unable to access functions like escape or editing strings like "sin")

i plan on adding an improved scope, floatbeat, custom samplerates, interpolation modes, downsampling, time skipping, and many other quality of life features
